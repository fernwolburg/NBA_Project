### NBA Clustering
####
#### This code clusters NBA teams according to their similarity based on the dataset provided. It also demonstrates the correlation between field goals, assists, and rebounds. Finally, the code allows you to select a specific team and identify which cluster it belongs to.

### NBA salary and wins
#### The code plots the NBA teams based on the team's salary and the number of games won. It shows a slight positive relationship. 
####
#### Together, the user can inspect the second scatter plot to identify teams that are close together. Then, the user can use "NBA clustering" to identify whether or not the teams that are similar based on salary and wins belong to the same cluster group for the machine learning algorithm. Overall, the data suggests that teams that have similar salaries and number of wins often belong to the same cluster, meaning that they have similar playing styles.
